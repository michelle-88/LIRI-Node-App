# LIRI-Node-App

### Introduction
LIRI is a command line Node application that provides movie, music, and concert data based on user search input. To utilize LIRI, the user would need to access the liri.js file within their terminal using Node. They can then enter one of the following 4 commands into the command line, along with their desired search term(s):

1. spotify-this-song (*song name here*)
2. concert-this (*artist/band name here*)
3. movie-this (*movie name here*)
4. do-what-it-says

LIRI will then provide pertinent information for the song, artist, or movie that was searched for. The do-what-it-says command will read the random.txt file in this application and run one of the aforementioned commands based on the information found within the file.

### Technologies Used
The following languages, Node packages, and APIs were used to build this application:

- Node.js
